[If you plan to attend it would be great if you could RSVP on meetup.com.](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/csharpUserKassel/events/265107391/) This way we can get a rough idea how many snacks we have to buy. But don't worry, it's not required to RSVP. 

## About Hacktoberfest  

### What's Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest—brought to you by DigitalOcean and GitHub—is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. No contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. [Sign up to participate today](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### Rules and Prizes

First sign up on the Hacktoberfest site. If you open up four pull requests between October 1 and October 31, you'll win a free, limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt. (Pull requests do not have to be merged and accepted; as long as they've been opened between the very start of October 1 and the very end of October 31, they count towards a free T-shirt.)

Connect with other Hacktoberfest participants (Hacktobefestants?) by using the hashtag, #Hacktoberfest, on your social media platform of choice.
